I’m an Infrastructure Engineer based in London, building my path toward Cloud and DevOps. I work across automation, scripting, and cloud environments — mostly with PowerShell, Python, and Azure — and I’m passionate about turning infrastructure into code and improving how systems are built and deployed.

💡 Current focus:

Studying for AZ-104 and AZ-305 certifications
Learning Terraform, CI/CD, Kubernetes, and Docker
Automating real-world infrastructure tasks and building internal tools

🛠️ Tech I use:

Languages: PowerShell, Python
Cloud: Azure, Google Cloud
DevOps: GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps
Other: VMware, IIS, Windows Server
